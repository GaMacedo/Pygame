"I'm following a tutorial from "The terrible programmer" from youtube.
His youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYpYQNHs2NN-J-UC7Pn4G5A

This tutorial is about using pygame to make a graphical roguelike.

This git is for me to be able to work from different computers, you can for this if you want but I highly recommend you to follow his tutorial on the youtube channel if you want to learn it too.
